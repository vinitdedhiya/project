"""BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD USED:"""
'''-Euler's Explicit method is used to numerically solve the given system of
    Differential Equations 
    
   -We start solving by using a set of arbitrary Guess Values and calculate 
    the values at the other end
    
   -However, these values are already known(fixed) as this is a BVP
    So, we can calculate the Error by taking the difference between
    the known values and the calculated values
    
   -This Error value is used to change the Initial Guess Value in order to
    get a Final Value within the Range of Accuracy required
    
   -The Process is repeated until the final solution converges by changing
    the Guess Value after every Iteration [SHOOTING METHOD] '''
